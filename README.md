## What Is A Pull Request

Pull requests are the main channel multiple developers use to collaborate on a single project. If one developer has changes they want to contribute to a project, they:

1. Create a new branch called, e.g., `cool-feature`
1. Make any changes they want to add to the main project on that new branch.
1. Submit request to merge their changes in `cool-feature` into `master` â€” this is the **pull request**
1. The team is notified that someone has opened a pull request.

## The Submission Flow

Let's say we're working on the [JavaScript Fundamentals I][github-fundamentals-i] exercises. This would be the flow (we'll share the git commands later):

1. Fork the main project/exercise repository to create your own copy
1. Start working on an exercise or iteration, e.g., the `isPrime` function.
1. Create a new branch on your copy and give it a sensible name like `is-prime`
1. Do the `isPrime` exercises, which might involve many commits, but they all live on the `is-prime` branch
1. Open a pull request to merge `is-prime` into **YOUR** forks's `master` branch.
1. Go to the pull request page and request a code review from an instructor. This is built into GitHub.

The feedback will happen on the pull request.

This process is called the *[feature branch workflow][atlassian-feature-branch-flow]* and is the most commonly used workflow for teams collaborating on a single repository.

1. Each new feature starts on its own branch (the so-called **feature branch**).
1. When the feature is ready, a pull request is submitted to merge the feature branch into the `master` branch.
1. A code review happens
1. If something need to be changed based on the review, those
1. Once everything looks good, the feature branch is merged into `master`.

## Practicing Pull Requests

We're going to create a pull request that contains two individual commits involving different files.

### Clone This Repository

Open VSCode (or your terminal) -- VSCode is recommended. Go to View -> Terminal to see your terminal (you can also "drag up" from the bar at the bottom of the screen). You will be typing the commands below into the terminal. When I open it, I see this:
```console
jocelynzhao@Jocelyns-MacBook-Pro ~ %
```
This indicates that I am in my home repository. Running `ls` lists the files and folders in my home repository. In my base repository, I have a folder called Desktop. To go into my Desktop folder, I run `cd Desktop` which shows

```console
jocelynzhao@Jocelyns-MacBook-Pro Desktop % 
```
I can continue navigating through my file storage system like this, until I find where I want to store my folder (I usually create a folder somewhere called SUBC and put all my SUBC related folders in there). Don't worry about doing this if it's too complicated though. 


Next, clone **your fork** using the `git clone` command. This will create a copy of your repository on your computer (called a *local copy*) that exists in your current folder.

**Note**: Replace `link` with the link under the green (code) button at the top of the repository

```console
git clone link
```

This will create a directory named `exercises-git-pull-request` inside the current working directory. Enter the directory with the following command:

```console
cd exercises-git-pull-request
```

You can now open this folder using VSCode. Press the file icon (Explorer), then press Open Folder. Navigate through your filesystem until you get to where you stored the folder `exercises-git-pull-request`. Select the `exercises-git-pull-request` folder and click open. This should load the folder into your VSCode. You will be able to add files and folders very easily by right-clicking on the left navigation bar. You can edit files by directly clicking on them, this should load the files into your main window.

**Note**: at this point, you may need to reopen your terminal. You can do this the same way as described earlier. 


### Create A Feature Branch

When we're inside a git repository, there is always an "active" branch. To see a list of all the branches run:

```console
git branch
```

The active branch is whichever one is prefixed with `*`. Because `master` is the only branch, you should see:

```console
$ git branch
* master
$
```

Let's create a new branch and switch to it. Run the following, replacing your-name with your actual name:

```console
git checkout -b your-name
```

Run `git branch` again and you should see:

```console
$ git branch
* your-name
  master
$
```

### Create `hello.txt`

**Note**: Remember to use commands like `ls` and `pwd` to verify you're in the correct directory and looking at the right files.

While on the `your-name` branch, create a file named `hello.txt` that contains the following text:

```text
Hello! This is my first pull request. My name is _____
```

Make sure to save the file. In the console, run the following command:

```console
git status
```

This gives you information about the current state of your git repository. It will show you which files have been modified, which files are new and have yet to be committed, etc.

Run the following `git add` command:

```console
git add hello.txt
```

Run `git status` again to see how the output changed.

### Commit `hello.txt`

Run the following command to create a new commit:

```console
git commit -m 'hello.txt is a lovely file'
```

Run `git status` and note how the output has changed.

### Create And Commit `goodbye.txt`

Let's create a second commit.

Create a file named `goodbye.txt` that contains the following text:

```text
Goodbye! About to submit my first pull request.
```

Again, run `git status` to see how the output has changed. Add and commit `goodbye.txt`.

To add it:

```console
git add goodbye.txt
```

Run `git status` and note how the output changed.

To commit it:

```console
git commit -m 'Time to say goodbye'
```

Run `git status` and note how the output changed.

### Push Your Local Changes Up To GitHub

Right now, your branch exists on your machine but doesn't yet exist on GitHub. To simultaneously push your changes up to GitHub and create the branch on GitHub, run the following command:

Replace `branch_name` with the name of the branch (should be your name, or whatever you named it earlier)

```console
git push --set-upstream origin branch_name
```

Here `origin` refers to GitHub.

Now visit your repository on GitHub.com!

### Create A Pull Request

On GitHub, you should see the following: <https://share.getcloudapp.com/YEud6DE4>

Click the **Compare & Pull Request**. On the next page, click **Create Pull Request**.

You can also get here by going to your branch in the Github page (click Branches to view all branches). On this page, beside the branch you want to submit a pull request for, click the three dots beside the garbage can. You should see a dropdown, one of which has the option to create a New Pull Request. 

You should see a screen that looks like below. Make sure that base repository is *changed* to UBC-SUBC/exercises-git-pull-request

This is what the **wrong** version looks like:
<img width="1264" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-17 at 10 19 32 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd11a71b-305d-469b-b1a7-8870a250b217">

This is what the correct version looks like:
<img width="1256" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-17 at 10 41 52 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27234fd2-3d2c-4173-9410-4175f029cd81">


Ta-da, first pull request!

## Merging Pull Request

You don't have to do this for this exercise, but it is good to know how to merge.
Once you're ready to go, merge your pull request into the `master` branch. There should be a green button that pops up on your pull request. You may need to have your code reviewed by another person first, depending on the rules for the repository.
